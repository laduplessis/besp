# Summary

Tests to check that the new Bayesian Skyline Plot implementation (`bsp.distributions.BSP`) returns the same likelihood as the `rskylinetools` `skyline_lk` function.
Keep in mind that the likelihoods computed in R need to be calculated with `full = FALSE`, which will remove the constant terms from the likelihood (as is done in the
BEAST2 implementation).

    
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
  knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
  
  rm(list = ls())
  library(beastio)
  library(rskylinetools)
  
  tol <- 1e-6
```

# Homochronous dataset (HCV)
  
Check that the maximum absolute difference between the likelihoods of the skyline plot calculated in BEAST2 and R are within the tolerance.

```{r lkTest1}
  
  lf         <- readLog("../../examples/BSP/output/hcv_bsp_mcpgamma_127.log", burnin=0)
  trees      <- readTreeLog("../../examples/BSP/output/hcv_bsp_mcpgamma_127.trees", burnin=0)
  
  popSizes   <- getLogFileSubset(lf, "bPopSizes")
  groupSizes <- getLogFileSubset(lf, "bGroupSizes")
  beastlk    <- lf[, "BayesianSkyline"]

  rlk <- sapply(1:length(beastlk), function(i) skyline_lk(trees[[i]], popSizes = popSizes[i,], segmentSizes = groupSizes[i,], full=FALSE))
  
  maxdiff <- max(abs(beastlk - rlk))
```

Maximum likelihood difference: `r sprintf("%12e",maxdiff)`

Pass test: **`r maxdiff < tol && maxdiff >= 0`**

# Heterochronous dataset (bison)

Check that the maximum absolute difference between the likelihoods of the skyline plot calculated in BEAST2 and R are within the tolerance.

```{r lkTest2}
  
  lf    <- readLog("../../examples/BSP/output/bison_bsp_mcpgamma_127.log", burnin=0)
  trees <- readTreeLog("../../examples/BSP/output/bison_bsp_mcpgamma_127.trees", burnin=0)

  popSizes   <- getLogFileSubset(lf, "bPopSizes")
  groupSizes <- getLogFileSubset(lf, "bGroupSizes")
  beastlk    <- lf[, "BayesianSkyline"]

  rlk <- sapply(1:length(beastlk), function(i) skyline_lk(trees[[i]], popSizes = popSizes[i,], segmentSizes = groupSizes[i,], full=FALSE))
  
  maxdiff <- max(abs(beastlk - rlk))
  
```

Maximum likelihood difference: `r sprintf("%12e",maxdiff)`

Pass test: **`r maxdiff < tol && maxdiff >= 0`**
