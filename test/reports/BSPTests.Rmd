# Summary

Tests to check that the new Bayesian Skyline Plot implementation (`bsp.distributions.BSP`) returns the same results as the old Bayesian Skyline Plot implementation in the BEAST2 core (`beast.evolution.tree.coalescent.BayesianSkyline`).
    
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
  knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
  
  rm(list = ls())
  library(beastio)
  library(rskylinetools)
  
  tol <- 1e-6

# Homochronous dataset (HCV)
  
## Likelihood comparison

Run two separate analyses with the same data, operators and seeds, using the old and new Bayesian skyline models. Check that the maximum absolute difference between the likelihoods of the old and new models are within the tolerance.

```{r lkTest1}
  
  lf1 <- readLog("../../examples/BSP/output/hcv_bspold_mcpgamma_127.log",  burnin=0)
  lf2 <- readLog("../../examples/BSP/output/hcv_bsp_mcpgamma_127.log", burnin=0)
  maxdiff <- max(abs(lf1[, "BayesianSkyline"] - lf2[, "BayesianSkyline"]))
```

Maximum likelihood difference: `r sprintf("%12e",maxdiff)`

Pass test: **`r maxdiff < tol && maxdiff >= 0`**


## Direct likelihood comparison

Run one analysis, with both the old and new models as treepriors, sharing the same parameters. Check that the maximum absolute difference between the likelihoods of the old and new models are within the tolerance.

```{r lkTest2} 

  lf <- readLog("../../examples/BSP/output/hcv_bsp_mcpgamma_skylinecomparison_127.log", burnin=0)
  maxdiff <- max(abs(lf[ ,"BayesianSkylineNew"] - lf[, "BayesianSkyline"]))

```

Maximum likelihood difference: `r sprintf("%12e",maxdiff)`

Pass test: **`r maxdiff < tol && maxdiff >= 0`**




## Change time logger comparison

Check that the change times logged by `BayesianSkylineChangeTimesLogger` are identical to the change times calculated from the logged trees. 

```{r changeTimesTest1} 
    
    # Change point times logged by change time logger
    lf <- readLog("../../examples/BSP/output/hcv_bsp_mcpgamma_127.log", burnin=0)
    changeTimes <- getLogFileSubset(lf, "bChangeTimes")
    
    # Calculate change point times from the logged trees and logged group sizes
    tree <- readTreeLog("../../examples/BSP/output/hcv_bsp_mcpgamma_127.trees", burnin=0)
    groupSizes <- getLogFileSubset(lf,"bGroupSizes")
    treeTimes  <- getChangeTimes(tree, groupSizes)
    
    maxdiff <- max(abs(changeTimes - treeTimes))
```

Maximum change time difference: `r sprintf("%12e",maxdiff)`

Pass test: **`r maxdiff < tol && maxdiff >= 0`**

## Likelihood comparison

Run two separate analyses with the same data, operators and seeds, using the old and new Bayesian skyline models. Check that the maximum absolute difference between the likelihoods of the old and new models are within the tolerance.

## Direct likelihood comparison

Run one analysis, with both the old and new models as treepriors, sharing the same parameters. Check that the maximum absolute difference between the likelihoods of the old and new models are within the tolerance.

```{r lkTest4} 

  lf <- readLog("../../examples/BSP/output/bison_bsp_mcpgamma_skylinecomparison_127.log", burnin=0)
  maxdiff <- max(abs(lf[ ,"BayesianSkylineNew"] - lf[, "BayesianSkyline"]))

```

Maximum likelihood difference: `r sprintf("%12e",maxdiff)`

Pass test: **`r maxdiff < tol && maxdiff >= 0`**



## Change time logger comparison

Check that the change times logged by `BayesianSkylineChangeTimesLogger` are identical to the change times calculated from the logged trees. 

```{r include=FALSE}

  #popSizes1 <- getLogFileSubset(lf1,"bPopSizes")
  #popSizes2 <- getLogFileSubset(lf2,"bPopSizes")
  
  #groupSizes1 <- getLogFileSubset(lf1,"bGroupSizes")
  #groupSizes2 <- getLogFileSubset(lf2,"bGroupSizes")
  
  #trees1 <- readTreeLog("../../examples/BSP/output/bison_bspold_mcpgamma_127.trees",  burnin=0)
  #trees2 <- readTreeLog("../../examples/BSP/output/bison_bsp_mcpgamma_127.trees",  burnin=0)
  
```

```{r changeTimesTest2} 
    
    # Change point times logged by change time logger
    lf <- readLog("../../examples/BSP/output/bison_bsp_mcpgamma_127.log", burnin=0)
    changeTimes <- getLogFileSubset(lf, "bPopSizeChangeTimes")
    
    # Calculate change point times from the logged trees and logged group sizes
    tree <- readTreeLog("../../examples/BSP/output/bison_bsp_mcpgamma_127.trees", burnin=0)
    groupSizes <- getLogFileSubset(lf,"bGroupSizes")
    treeTimes  <- getChangeTimes(tree, groupSizes)
    
    maxdiff <- max(abs(changeTimes - treeTimes))
```
